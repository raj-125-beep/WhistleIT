🕵️‍♂️ WhistleIT

A decentralized, anonymous, and collaborative whistleblower platform powered by Solana Anchor.

WhistleIT is a secure platform that empowers individuals to report misconduct, corruption, or injustice anonymously — and enables others to contribute to the same case to build stronger evidence trails. NGOs, journalists, and authorities can request access to verified reports based on the whistleblower's consent. The platform demonstrates practical blockchain applications, including immutability, secure multi-party access, and decentralized storage.

🚀 Features

🔒 Anonymous Reporting via Phantom Wallet (no personal data required)
🧾 Case Submission with title, description, tags, and evidence
👥 Multi-Contributor Trails — multiple users can contribute to the same case
🗳️ Community Voting (upvote/downvote) to highlight significant reports
🕸️ Decentralized Storage using Solana and optionally IPFS/Arweave
👨‍⚖️ NGO/Journalist Access (consent-based, wallet-gated messaging)
🌐 Reddit-style UI with feed, explore, and case details

🛠 Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
🧠 Smart Contract	Rust + Anchor on Solana
💼 Wallet Integration	Phantom Wallet
🌐 Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript (MVP version) / Flutter (future mobile app)
🧾 Off-chain Storage	IPFS or Arweave (optional for evidence)
🔗 Solana Dev Tools	Solana CLI, Anchor CLI, @project-serum/anchor


🧑‍💻 My Contributions

Designed and implemented Solana smart contracts for case submission, multi-contributor logic, and wallet-gated access.
Integrated Phantom Wallet authentication and client-side transaction handling.
Built the front-end MVP for submitting, viewing, and contributing to cases.
Ensured secure, privacy-preserving workflows for anonymous reporting.
Explored decentralized storage integration with IPFS/Arweave for evidence management.

📝 How It Works

User logs in via Phantom Wallet (no sign-up needed).
Submits a case anonymously with metadata + optional proof.
Others can see minimal info and contribute if relevant.
NGOs/Journalists can request access and chat with the original whistleblower (only if granted).
Community can upvote/downvote to highlight serious cases.

🎯 Vision

WhistleIT aims to bring transparency, protection, and collaboration to those who speak up against injustice — without putting themselves at risk. 
It combines decentralized governance, immutability, and secure access controls to demonstrate real-world applications of blockchain principles.

🧠 Inspired By

WikiLeaks and secure whistleblowing systems
Decentralized governance and trustless systems
Research areas like zero-knowledge proofs, secure multiparty computation, and decentralized protocols
